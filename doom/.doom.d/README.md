## Enable Olivetti

To enable oliveti on a per file basis add this line to the top of the file.

`# -*- olivetti-body-width: 140; eval: (olivetti-mode); -*-`

## ORG-GCAl 

To enable org-gcal you need to set up some client serets and credentials. Follow the instructions on org-gcals [README](https://github.com/myuhe/org-gcal.el#installation). 

Once you have those set up ensure you're setting the appropriate variables for your personal config. All the dotfiles here do is install org-gcal and enable it. You still need a mechanism to configure it.
